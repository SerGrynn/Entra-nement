## Instructions
> Your dog has asked you to create him a function that checks whether the path of his walkies is acceptable
> A good dog walk will take exactly 10 mins and ends up right where you started.
> It takes exactly 1 minute to walk a city block.
> You can only move in 4 directions (north, south, east, west)
> A dog walk is expressed as an array containing the directions in sequence

> example: ['n', 'n', 'e', 'e', 's', 'w', 's', 'w', 'n', 's'] -- is a good walk
> ['n', 's'] -- is not, because it only takes 2 minutes.
> ['n', 'n'] -- is not, because it only takes 2 minutes and doesn't end at the start

> write a function that takes in an array and returns true for a good walk path, and false for one that isn't
